It has been demonstrated that machine learning models can be utilized to obtain accurate soliton solutions. In our numerical experiments, we have established that random forest is best suitable for this task since it shows least error and simultaneously takes least time to train similar sized dataset. Nonetheless, neural networks can be equally used for these type of tasks.
